File I/O Project
This project consists of several C programs and functions that perform various file input and output operations. These programs are designed to read, create, and manipulate files. They also include a program to display information about the ELF header of a file.

Project Tasks
The project is divided into the following tasks:

1. read_textfile - A function that reads a text file and prints its contents to the standard output.

2. create_file - A function that creates a file with specified permissions and writes text content to it. If the file already exists, it will be truncated.

3. append_text_to_file - A function that appends text content to the end of an existing file.

4. cp (File Copy Program) - A program that copies the contents of one file to another file. It handles errors such as missing files, read and write failures, and file descriptor issues.

5. elf_header (Advanced Task) - A program that displays information about the ELF header at the start of an ELF file
